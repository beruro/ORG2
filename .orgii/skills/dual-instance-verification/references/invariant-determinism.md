# Invariant and Determinism Cells

These cells are mandatory for every dual-instance verification run. They catch
silent surplus actions that presence-only foreground checks cannot see.

## Two-boot determinism

With local state unchanged, cold-boot the instance twice and let sync passes run.
Boot 2 must produce zero epoch rewrites and zero destructive-effect hits. Boot 1
may re-anchor once after a legitimate format/order change, but every rewrite must
be explained as exactly-once.

## Absence requires liveness

Pair every "zero X" claim with a mover proving the engine ran over the rows in
question: `events_count`, `updated_at`, or an explicit pass counter. Deferred or
skipped sessions are uncovered, not passing.

## Fault injection

Run at least one degraded-state cell per verification. Rotate among moving a
local source database mid-read, blocking identity lookup, and terminating the app
mid-transfer. The system must defer or refuse destructive work under the fault.

## Unexplained deltas

Promote the first unexplained ledger delta, log line, resource pattern, or
store-versus-UI discrepancy to a scenario in the current run. Do not close it as
"background noise" or defer it without a mechanism-level verdict.

## Baseline attribution

Baseline A/B establishes attribution, not correctness. Record separately:

1. whether the current PR caused the symptom; and
2. whether the symptom is a defect or expected behavior, with the mechanism.

If the local store contains rows while the UI renders none, treat the mismatch as
a defect until the command and filter responsible are identified.
